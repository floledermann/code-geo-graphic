# What about the code?  
## Call for contributions

In this workshop we consider computer code for for geographic or cartographic projects. Participants discuss their code, othersâ€™ code, and code within geo/cartographic contexts in general. Exchange and identification of research issues will be the focus. 

Contributions should be prepared in advance for lightning talks (maximum 5 minutes and 5 slides). They can include:

* An interesting piece of code that facilitated a (past or ongoing) project. This is (probably) not a stand-alone program and should be limited to 20 lines or so.

* A brief essay-style presentation reflecting on code and its role in a project, asking questions about it, and/or investigating its affordances and implications. Visuals can be optional, even if the code helped produce a map.

On the day of the meet-up, participants present their contributions in a series of lightening talks. After lunch, using an unconference format break-out group discussions about sharing code, making code and thinking about future mapmaking coding projects. A workshop board collects results of these discussions. A moderated discussion of the topics concludes the workshop. 

We welcome contributions from scholars at all stages of their career and at all levels of coding proficiency.

Please send your ideas (with or without actual code) to {{site.email}}
